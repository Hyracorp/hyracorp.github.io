                    <b>Fees:</b> The User acknowledges that by utilizing the Site to pay for rent or security deposits, Hyracorp may charge them a service charge.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Transaction Limits:</b> Hyracorp reserves the right to refuse, suspend, or delay a transaction for any payment for any reason, including but not limited to if Hyracorp believes the transaction could put it at risk financially or security-wise or if it is unauthorized, fraudulent, suspicious, illegal, in violation of this Agreement's terms, up for dispute, or otherwise unusual.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Chargebacks:</b> If a transaction is (a) disputed by the sender, (b) reversed for any reason, (c) not authorized or Hyracorp has reason to believe that it was not authorized, or (d) purportedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of this Agreement, the amount of the transaction may be charged back or reversed to the User (a "Chargeback"). The amount of any Chargeback and any related fees, fines, or penalties assessed by Hyracorp's Processor, processing financial institutions, MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover, and other payment card networks, associations, or companies ("Networks") are due and payable by the Users to Hyracorp immediately. Users consent to help Hyracorp look into any of their transactions handled through the Service upon request, at their own expense. When it comes to chargebacks related to cards, Hyracorp will assist users in disputing the chargeback with the Network or the issuing banks, should they so desire. In order to contest the Chargeback, Hyracorp will, in this regard, require certain information from the User. If the User fails to provide the required documentation within 5 business days of Hyracorp's request, among other things, to help Hyracorp promptly in its investigation of a transaction, there may be an irreversible Chargeback.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Liability: </b>The Users grant Hyracorp release from any liability for any matter resulting from a disagreement between the Users and the Processor, or between the Users and their bank or other financial institution. Please be aware that Hyracorp disclaims all duty in this regard and that it shall not be liable for any additional fees or charges that the Processors deduct while processing payments in connection with the User's transaction. In addition, before authorizing any payments through the Processors, Users should review any additional terms and conditions that may be imposed by these Processors.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Fraud and restrictions:</b> If Hyracorp determines that it needs more documentation (such as a rental agreement, owner/tenant PAN, or maintenance bill), it may do so, especially if the transaction appears suspect. In the event that Hyracorp decides that a payment is fraudulent or that it is not a legal rent, token, security deposit, or maintenance payment, Hyracorp will return the full amount (less the nominal processing fees that Hyracorp has collected) unconditionally. A legally binding rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant, for which the rent amount is equal to what is being sent on Hyracorp Pay, is a prerequisite for a valid rent or security deposit payment. A maintenance bill between the payer and the society/RWA is required for a maintenance payment to be considered genuine.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Refunds:</b> If Hyracorp encounters any technical issues and is unable to arrange the transfer of the rent amount to the beneficiary account, Hyracorp will return the payment to the source. It is advised that until a reimbursement ID is generated and delivered to the Users via email and SMS, they should not transfer the rent directly to the landlord.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Users understand and accept that, to the fullest extent allowed by law, they bear all risk related to their use of and access to the payment services. If Users allow or approve someone else to use their Hyracorp account in any way, Users will be held accountable for everything that person does. For any incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages, such as lost profits, data loss, or goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure, or the cost of substitute goods or services, Hyracorp, any other party, or Processor involved in developing, producing, or delivering the payment Services shall not be liable.

Cookies are only allowed to hold personal data that you provide. Data on your hard drive or device cannot be read by a cookie.

                  <h4><b>Choosing not to</b></h4>
                  The specific DoubleClick cookie ID on the User's browser is replaced with the words "Choosing not to" if the User chooses not to participate using the Ads Settings. The opt-out cookie cannot be connected to a specific browser because it no longer has a unique cookie ID.<br><br>

We also make sure that any personal information—including sensitive personal information—that is found to be inaccurate or lacking is corrected or amended as soon as possible, provided that it is not required to be kept for legal or legitimate business purposes. Before granting requests, we ask users to identify themselves and the information they would like accessed, corrected, or removed. We reserve the right to refuse requests that are excessively repetitive or systematic, that would require disproportionate technical work, that compromise the privacy of others, that would be extremely impractical (such as requests involving data stored on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise necessary. In every event, unless doing so would involve an excessive amount of work, we provide free information access and rectification services. After you erase your information, residual copies may take some time to be removed from our active servers due to the way we maintain certain services.

The company-controlled database safely holds all of the data collected on TIL. The database is kept on firewall-protected servers, and access to the servers is carefully controlled and password-protected. No security system is impenetrable, notwithstanding how effective our security measures are.
